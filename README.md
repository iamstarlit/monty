## 0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO
Stacks and Queues are two fundamental data structures in computer science  
that are used to store and manage collection of data/elements.   

### Stacks
A stack is data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle,  
meaning that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.   

#### main operations of stacks
* push - adds an element to the top of the stack.
* pop - removes and element from the stack.   

### Queues
A queue is a data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out(FIFO) principle,  
meaning the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed.   

#### main operations of queues
* enqueue - adds an element to the back of the queue.
* dequeue - removes the front element of the queue.
